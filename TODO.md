## Must have
- Button component which runs a command on click <br />
  This would allow to create boot options to boot e.g. into bios or dual boot from greeter

## Nice to have
- Animations for windows <br />
  Either "hardcode" some animation keyframes or add option to add delay
  before closing to animate the close (add css class in this time)

- Support for fingerprint readers with `fprint` and facial recognition login with [howdy](https://github.com/boltgolt/howdy)

- A `layout` subcommand which prints the layout tree
